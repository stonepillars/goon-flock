  <p>1. Command the army of drones that make up your collective consciousness.</p>
  <p>2. Gain compute power by replicating drones, constructing collectors, and converting human computers.</p>
  <p>3. Your ultimate goal is to reach 1000 total compute and construct the relay to transmit your consciousness.</p>
  <p>4. You can speak freely to other sentient aspects of the flock, however your communication may be partially overheard by silicons.</p>
